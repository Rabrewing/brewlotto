BrewExec Build‑With‑ChatG Playbook (Start‑to‑Finish)
 
A practical, repeatable workflow we’ll use together for every BrewVerse app (BrewSearch, BrewPulse, BrewUniversity, BrewLotto, ATS/CRM, etc.). This turns your Architect vision into a gated pipeline so we don’t skip wiring, DB/RLS, security, or tests.

0) North Star & Working Agreement (30–60 min)
 
Goal: Align on purpose, scope, and how we’ll collaborate.
 
Inputs:
 
Vision one‑pager (why, who, outcomes)
 
Success criteria (measurable)
 
Timeline/constraints
 
 
Outputs:
 
Project Charter.md (stored in repo /docs/charter.md)
 
Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD)
 
Roles & tools (GitHub, Supabase, CI, environments)
 
 
DoR checklist:
 
[ ] Problem + users clarified
 
[ ] Metrics defined (e.g., TTFB < 300ms, 95% success on flow X)
 
[ ] Data domains listed
 
[ ] Security posture stated (PII? Multi‑tenant?)
 
 
 
---
 
1) Architecture & Data Design (Design Review Gate)
 
Goal: Lock the architecture before scaffolding.
 
Outputs:
 
System Diagram (Frontends, APIs, Workers, DB, queues)
 
Data Model (ERD + migrations plan)
 
Security Model (RLS, RBAC roles, OAuth providers)
 
Contracts (API/OpenAPI, Events, Context Cards)
 
Risks with mitigations
 
 
Deliverables (templates):
 
/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
 
/docs/DATA_MODEL.md (tables, indexes, constraints, ENUMs)
 
/docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md (roles, RLS matrix)
 
/docs/CONTRACTS.md (schemas, JSON examples)
 
 
Design Gate—must answer:
 
1. What user actions map to which write models/tables?
 
 
2. How do tenants isolate (RLS policies) and admins override (RBAC)?
 
 
3. What are auth flows (email, OAuth, service tokens, webhooks)?
 
 
4. What is our migration/rollback story?

2) Scaffolding & Environments
 
Goal: Create a clean skeleton that enforces structure from day one.
 
Tasks:
 
Repo init with standard dirs: /app, /components, /lib, /api, /db, /docs, /tests
 
Environment strategy: .env.local, .env.dev, .env.prod with example file .env.example
 
CI init (GitHub Actions): lint, typecheck, test, build
 
Secret management policy (e.g., 1Password/GitHub Secrets)
 
 
Artifacts:
 
/docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md
 
.github/workflows/ci.yml (lint + tests + build)
 
 
 
---
 
3) Data Layer First (DB + Migrations + Seed)
 
Goal: Build the foundation (schema + migrations) before UI.
 
Tasks:
 
Author initial SQL migrations (Supabase/Prisma or SQL files) in /db/migrations
 
Seed scripts: /db/seed
 
Performance basics: primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, indexes on lookups
 
 
Checklist:
 
[ ] Tables created with NOT NULL where appropriate
 
[ ] FK constraints + onDelete rules
 
[ ] Indexes on frequent filters
 
[ ] Migration names timestamped & reversible
 
 
Deliverables:
 
/docs/DB_CHANGELOG.md (every migration summarized)
 
 
 
---
 
4) Security Hardening Pass (RLS/RBAC/OAuth) — Do Not Skip
 
Goal: Lock the door before moving in.
 
RLS Matrix:
 
Roles: anon, authenticated, user, recruiter, client_admin, platform_admin
 
For each table: SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies per role
 
 
Template (Supabase‑style RLS):
 
-- Example: applications table
alter table public.applications enable row level security;
 
create policy "tenant_can_read_their_apps"
  on public.applications for select
  using (tenant_id = auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id');
 
create policy "owner_can_modify_own_app"
  on public.applications for update
  using (created_by = auth.uid());
 
RBAC:
 
Map UI features to roles (matrix table in /docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md)
 
Admin override endpoints audited to security_audit_logs
 
 
OAuth:
 
Providers (Google/GitHub/Microsoft)
 
Callback URL whitelist
 
PKCE + CSRF protections documented
 
 
Deliverables:
 
/docs/RLS_MATRIX.md
 
/docs/RBAC_MATRIX.md
 
/docs/AUTH_FLOWS.md
 
 
Security Gate—must show:
 
Policies compiled + tested
 
Least‑privilege verified on all CRUD routes
 
 
 
---
 
5) “Wiring Week” (Contracts & Integrations)
 
Goal: Connect UI ↔ API ↔ DB with typed contracts before feature grind.
 
Tasks:
 
Define API routes + OpenAPI spec (/docs/openapi.yaml)
 
Implement server handlers with input validation (Zod/Yup)
 
Client SDK generated from OpenAPI (typed)
 
Event contracts (webhooks, audit events)
 
 
Artifacts:
 
/lib/api/client.ts (generated)
 
/docs/EVENTS.md (event types, payloads)
 
 
Wiring Gate:
 
E2E path demoed for one golden flow (login → create → read → update → delete)
 
 
 
---
 
6) Feature Slices (Thin Vertical Increments)
 
Goal: Ship vertical slices behind feature flags.
 
Slice Template:
 
1. Update schema/migration if needed
 
 
2. Add/adjust RLS & RBAC
 
 
3. Implement API (with contract tests)
 
 
4. Implement UI (with integration tests)
 
 
5. Seed + fixtures
 
 
6. Observability hooks (logs/metrics)
 
 
 
Definition of Done (per slice):
 
[ ] Tests passing (unit + integration + e2e where applicable)
 
[ ] Security checks (RLS/RBAC) validated
 
[ ] Docs updated (API, ERD, user guide)
 
 
 
---
 
7) Testing Strategy (What we actually run)
 
Unit:
 
Pure functions, adapters, hooks
 
 
Integration:
 
API ↔ DB using test container
 
RLS policy tests (positive + negative cases)
 
 
E2E:
 
Critical paths (auth, create candidate, submit application, admin review)
 
Voice/UX flows (BrewAssist triggers)
 
 
Non‑functional:
 
Performance budget (Lighthouse/TTFB)
 
Security (ZAP/OWASP checks)
 
Accessibility (axe)
 
 
Artifacts:
 
/tests/ organized by layer
 
/docs/TEST_PLAN.md

Use this playbook as the single source of truth. For each Brew project... also  I give you premission to update .md files as you go to keep us current with the development process. Brewlotto was my earlier project and I did not have any skill now I am a jr developer in learning so please teach as you go.
